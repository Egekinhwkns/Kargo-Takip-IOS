# Kargo-Takip-IOS
This is the Parcel Tracker application for our university project. It allows users who log into their google account to track their cargo through a single application.
This project was carried out with 2 people. This is the IOS part of the project and made by me, the other part is processing on our backend server which has done by Gökay
Çulpan. The repository link for our backend codes is: github.com/gkyclpn/kargo-takip-backend
